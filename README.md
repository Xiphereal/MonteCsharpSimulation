# Monte CSharp Simulation

A simple implementation of the [Monte Carlo Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) in C# for forecasting a bunch of task completion.

Both the implementation idea and the concept behind it comes from the book _When Will It Be Done_, by Daniel Vacanti
